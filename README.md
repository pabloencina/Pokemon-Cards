# Pokemon-Cards
In this project called PokeApi I work with JS, HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap. The main objective of this work is to bring through the API "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto" the pokemons contained in a card, each one showing its ID and its power in a POP-UP, It contains a separate pokemon search engine.
